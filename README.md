# casey-lm

development:
- to run in colab, open an ipynb notebook in github, then change the url from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com' (as instructed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62596466/how-can-i-run-notebooks-of-a-github-project-in-google-colab))

todo:
- add readme details
- allow options for tokenization method, attention type, norm type, activation function, positional encoding, dataset, optimizer, scheduler, and other hyperparameters
- other impls: tinygrad, scratch, lua torch, julia mlj, julia flux
- More sophisticated architecture (maybe)
- Edge optimized version
- Pruning, quantization, etc.
- Distributed training
